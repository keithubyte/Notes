### Prefer executors and tasks to threads

Choosing the executor service for a particular application can be tricky. If you're writing a small program, or a lightly loaded server, using `Executors.newCachedThreadPool` is generally a good choice, as it demands no configuration and generally "does the right thing". But a cached thread pool is not a good choice for a heavily loaded production server! In a cached thread pool, submitted tasks are not queued but immediately handed off to a thread for execution. If no threads are available, a new one is created. If a server is so heavily loaded that all of its CPUs are fully utilized, and more tasks arrive, more threads will be created, which will only make matters worse. Therefore, in a heavily loaded production server, you are much better off using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool`, which gives you a pool with a fixed number of threads, or using the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class directly, for maximum control.
