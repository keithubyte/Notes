# Use instance fields instead of ordinals

Many enums are naturally associated with a single `int` value. All enums have an `ordinal` method, which returns the numberical position of each enum constant in its type. You may be tempted to derive an associated `int` value from the ordinal:

```java
// Abuse of ordinal to derive an associated value -- DON'T DO THIS
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO, DUET, TRIO, QUARTET, QUINTET,
    SEXTET, SEPTET, QUTET, NONET, DECTECT;
}

public int numberOfMusicians() {
    return ordinal() + 1;
}
```

While this enum works, it is a maintenance nightmare. If the constants are recorded, the **numberOfMusicians** method will break. If you want to add a second enum constant associated with an **int** value that you've already used, you're out of luck. For example, it might be nice to add a constant for *double quartet*, which, like an octet, consists of eight misicians, but there is no way to do it.

Also, you can't add a constant for an **int** value without adding constants for all intervening **int** values. For example, suppose you want to add a constant representing a *triple quartet*, which consists of twelve musicians. There is no standard term for an ensemble consisting of eleven musicians, so you are forced to add a dummy constant for the unused **int** value. At best, this is ugly. If many **int** values are unused, it's impractical.

Luckily, there is a simple solution to these problems. **Never derive a value associated with an enum from its ordinal; store it in an instance field instead:**

```java
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO(1), DUET(2), TRIO(3), QUARTET(4), QUINTET(5),
    SEXTET(6), SEPTET(7), OCTET(8), DOUBLE_QUARTET(8),
    NONET(9), DECTET(10), TRIPLE_QUARTET(12);
    
    private final int numberOfMusicans;
    
    Ensemble(int size) {
        this.numberOfMusicians = size;
    }
    
    public int numberOfMusicians() {
        return numberOfMusicians;
    }
}
```

The Enum specification has this to say about ordinal: "Most programmers will have no use for this method. It is designed for use by general-purpose enum-based data structures such as **EnumSet** and **EnumMap**." Unless you are writing such a data structure, you are best off avoiding the **ordinal** method entirely."
