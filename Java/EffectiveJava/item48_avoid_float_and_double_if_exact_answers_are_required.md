### Item48 : Avoid float and double if exact answers are required

----------

The `float` and `double` types are designed primarily for scientific and engineering calculations. They perform *binary floating-point arithmetic*, which was carefully designed to furnish accurate approximations quickly over a broad range of magnitudes. They do not, however, provide exact results and should not be used where exact results are required. **The `float` and `double` types are particularly ill-suited for monetary calculations** because it is impossible to represent 0.1(or any other negative power of ten) as a `float` or `double` exactly.

Use `BigDecimal` if you want the system to keep track of the decimal point and you don't mind the inconvenience and cost of not using a primitive type. Using `BigDecimal` has the added advantage that it gives you full control over rounding, letting you select from eight rounding modes whenever an operation that entails rounding is performed. This comes in handy if you're performing business calculations with legally mandated rounding behavior. If performance is of the essence, you don't mind keeping track of the decimal point yourself, and the quantities aren't too big, us `int` or `long` . If the quantities don't exceed nine decimal digits, you can use `int`; if they don't exceed eighteen digits, you can use `long`. If the quantities might exceed eighteen digits, you must use `BigDecimal`.
