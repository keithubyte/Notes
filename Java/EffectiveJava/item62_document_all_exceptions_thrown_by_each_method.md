### Document all exceptions thrown by each method

**Always declare checked exceptions individually, and document precisely the conditions under which each one is thrown using the Javadoc @throws tag**.

**Use the Javadoc `@throws` tag to document each unchecked exception that a method can throw, but do not use the throws keyword to include unchecked exceptions in the method declaration**. It is important that the programmers using your API be aware of which exceptions are checked and which are unchecked, as their responsibilities differ in these two cases. The documentation generated by the Javadoc `@throws` tag in the absence of the method header generated by the `throws` declaration provides a strong visual cue to help the programmer distinguish checked exceptions from unchecked.

**If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, it is acceptable to document the exception in the class's documentation comment rather than documenting it individually for each method.**

In summary, document every exception that can be thrown by each method that you write. This is true for unchecked as well as checked exceptions, and for abstract as well as concrete methods. Provide individual `throws` clauses for each checked exception and do not provide `throws` clauses for unchecked exceptions. If you fail to document the exceptions that your methods can throw, it will be difficult or impossible for others to make effective use of your classes and interfaces.
