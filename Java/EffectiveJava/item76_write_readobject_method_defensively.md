### Item76 : Write readObject methods defensively

----------

Consider the following class:

```java
/**
 * Immutable class that uses defensive copying
 */
public class Period {
    private final Date start;
    private final Date end;
    
    public Period(Date start, Date end) {
        this.start = new Date(start.getTime());
        this.end = new Date(end.getTime());
        if (this.start.compareTo(end) > 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(start + " after " + end);
        }
    }
    
    public Date start() {
        return new Date(start.getTime());
    }
    
    public Date end() {
        return new Date(end.getTime());
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return start + " - " + end;
    }
}
```

Suppose you decide that you want this class to be serializable. Because the physical representation of a `Period` object exactly mirrors its logical data content, it is not unreasonable to use the default serialized form. Therefore, it might seem that all you have to do to make the class serializable is to add the words "`implements Serializable`" to the class declaration. If you did so, however, the class would no longer guarantee it critical invariants.

The problem is that the `readObject` method is effectively another public constructor, and it demands all of the same care as any other constructor. Just as a constructor must check its arguments for validity and make defensive copies of parameters where appropriate, so must a `readObject` method. If a `readObject` method fails to do either of these things, it is a relatively simple matter for an attacker to violate the class's invariants.

Loosely speaking, `readObject` is a constructor that takes a byte stream as its sole parameter. In normal use, the byte stream is generated by serializing a normally constructed instance. The problem arises when `readObject` is presented with a byte stream that is artificially constructed to generate an object that violates the invariants of its class. Assume that we simply added `implements Serializable` to the class declaration for `Period`. This ugly program would then generate a `Period` instance whose end precedes its start:

```java
public class BogusPeriod {

    // Byte stream could not have come from real Period instance!
    private static final byte[] serializedForm = new byte[] { (byte) 0xac,
            (byte) 0xed, 0x00, 0x05, 0x73, 0x72, 0x00, 0x06, 0x50, 0x65, 0x72,
            0x69, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x40, 0x7e, (byte) 0xf8, 0x2b, 0x4f, 0x46,
            (byte) 0xc0, (byte) 0xf4, 0x02, 0x00, 0x02, 0x4c, 0x00, 0x03, 0x65,
            0x6e, 0x64, 0x74, 0x00, 0x10, 0x4c, 0x6a, 0x61, 0x76, 0x61, 0x2f,
            0x75, 0x74, 0x69, 0x6c, 0x2f, 0x44, 0x61, 0x74, 0x65, 0x3b, 0x4c,
            0x00, 0x05, 0x73, 0x74, 0x61, 0x72, 0x74, 0x71, 0x00, 0x7e, 0x00,
            0x01, 0x78, 0x70, 0x73, 0x72, 0x00, 0x0e, 0x6a, 0x61, 0x76, 0x61,
            0x2e, 0x75, 0x74, 0x69, 0x6c, 0x2e, 0x44, 0x61, 0x74, 0x65, 0x68,
            0x6a, (byte) 0x81, 0x01, 0x4b, 0x59, 0x74, 0x19, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00,
            0x78, 0x70, 0x77, 0x08, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x66, (byte) 0xdf, 0x6e,
            0x1e, 0x00, 0x78, 0x73, 0x71, 0x00, 0x7e, 0x00, 0x03, 0x77, 0x08,
            0x00, 0x00, 0x00, (byte) 0xd5, 0x17, 0x69, 0x22, 0x00, 0x78 };

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Period p = (Period) deserialize(serializedForm);
        System.out.println(p);
    }

    // Returns the object with the specified serialized form
    private static Object deserialize(byte[] sf) {
        try {
            InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(sf);
            ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is);
            return ois.readObject();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);
        }
    }

}
```

The byte array literal used to initialize `serializedFrom` was generated by serializing a normal `Period` instance and hand-editing the resulting byte stream. If you run this program, it prints "Fri Jan 01 12:00:00 PST 1999 - Sun Jan 01 12:00:00 PST 1984". Simply declaring `Period` serializable enabled us to create an object that violates its class invariants.

To fix this problem, provide a `readObject` method for `Period` that calls `defaultReadObject` and then checks the validity of the deserialized object. If the validity check fails, the `readObject` method throws an `InvalidObjectException`, preventing the deserialization from completing:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
	s.defaultReadObject();

	// Check that our invariants are satisfied
	if (start.compareTo(end) > 0) {
		throw new InvalidObjectException(start + " after " + end);
	}
}
```

While this fix prevents an attacker from creating an invalid `Period` instance, there is a more subtle problem still lurking. It is possible to create a mutable `Period` instance by fabricating a byte stream that begins with a valid `Period` instance and then appends extra references to the private `Date` fields internal to the `Period` instance. The attacker reads the `Period` instance from the `ObjectInputStream` and then reads the "rogue object references" that were appended to the stream. These references give the attacker access to the objects referenced by the private `Date` fields within the `Period` object. Bu mutating these `Date` instances, the attacker can mutate the `Period` instance. The following class demonstrates this attack: 

```java
public class MutablePeriod {

    // A period instance
    public final Period period;

    // period's start field, to which we shouldn't have access
    public final Date start;

    // period's end field, to which we shouldn't have access
    public final Date end;

    public MutablePeriod() {
        try {
            ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
            ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);

            // Serialize a valid Period instance
            out.writeObject(new Period(new Date(), new Date()));

			/*
			 * Append rogue "previous object refs" for internal Date fields in
			 * Period. For details, see "Java Object Serialization
			 * Specification," Section 6.4.
			 */
            byte[] ref = { 0x71, 0, 0x7e, 0, 5 }; // Ref #5
            bos.write(ref); // The start field
            ref[4] = 4; // Ref # 4
            bos.write(ref); // The end field

            // Deserialize Period and "stolen" Date references
            ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(
                    new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray()));
            period = (Period) in.readObject();
            start = (Date) in.readObject();
            end = (Date) in.readObject();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new AssertionError(e);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MutablePeriod mp = new MutablePeriod();
        Period p = mp.period;
        Date pEnd = mp.end;

        // Let's turn back the clock
        pEnd.setYear(78);
        System.out.println(p);

        // Bring back the 60s!
        pEnd.setYear(69);
        System.out.println(p);
    }
    
}
```

Running this program produces the following output:

```java
Wed Apr 02 11:04:26 PDT 2008 - Sun Apr 02 11:04:26 PST 1978
Wed Apr 02 11:04:26 PDT 2008 - Wed Apr 02 11:04:26 PST 1969
```

The source of the problem is that `Period`'s `readObject` method is not doing enough defensive copying. **When an object is deserialized, it is critical to defensively copy any field containing an object reference that a client must not possess**. Therefore, every serializable immutable class containing private mutable components must defensively copy these components in its `readObject` method. The following `readObject` method suffices to ensure `Period`'s invariants and to maintain its immutability:

```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
	s.defaultReadObject();

	// Defensively copy our mutable components
	start = new Date(start.getTime());
	end = new Date(end.getTime());

	// Check that our invariants are satisfied
	if (start.compareTo(end) > 0) {
		throw new InvalidObjectException(start + " after " + end);
	}
}
```

#### Summary

To summarize, anytime you write a `readObject` method, adopt the mind-set that you are writing a public constructor that must produce a valid instance regardless of what byte stream it is given. Do not assume that the byte stream represents an actual serialized instance. While the examples in this item concern a class that uses the default serialized from, all of the issues that were raised apply equally to classes with custom serialized forms. Here, in summary form, are the guidelines for writing a bulletproof `readObject` method:

- For class with object reference fields that must remain private, defensively copy each object in such a field. Mutable components of immutable classes fall into this category.
- Check any invariants and throw an `InvalidObjectException` if a check fails. The checks should follow any defensive copying.
- If an entire object graph must be validated after it is deserialized, use the `ObjectInputValidation` interface.
- Do not invoke any overridable methods in the class, directly or indirectly.
